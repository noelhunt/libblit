Compiling with no flags will generate a terminal identical to Tom Cargill's
1985 original.

Compile-time flags:

HALFDUPLEX	Gives padsterm the feel of a terminal window on the Blit.

SCROLL		Changes the scrolling behaviour; this was originally part
		of the 'jtools' port.

SAMTERM		In conjuction with SCROLL makes  scroll  bars  look  like
		samterm's  scroll bars, with a 1-pixel border between the
		scrollbar proper and the text.

TAGS		The text in the sentinel line is now displayed in a back-
		ground  colour.  The  tag does not scroll, in contrast to
		the original pads design where the sentinel line is  dis-
		played  as  the  first line in the pad but is scrolled as
		normal which means the 'banner' can become invisible.
